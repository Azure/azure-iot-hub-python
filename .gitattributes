# Default behavior: if Git thinks a file is text (as opposed to binary), it
# will normalize line endings to LF in the repository, but convert to your
# platform's native line endings on checkout (e.g., CRLF for Windows).
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout. E.g.,
*.md text=auto
*.json text=auto
*.ps1 text=auto

# Declare files that will always have LF line endings on checkout. E.g.,
*.sh text eol=lf

# Denote all files that should not have line endings normalized, should not be
# merged, and should not show in a textual diff.
